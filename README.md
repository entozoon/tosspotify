# Tosspotify

Control Spotify with global hotkeys (a la [Toastify](https://github.com/aleab/toastify) - which is dead at time of writing).

Keyboard shortcuts simply trigger media key presses, rather than being wired up to [Spotify Web API](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node), although that could be a fun way to expand in future (song name popups and whatnot).

## Run

    npm i
    npm start

## Shortcuts

| Keys       |       Command |
| ---------- | ------------: |
| ctrl-alt-x |  Play / Pause |
| ctrl-alt-c |     Next song |
| ctrl-alt-v | Previous song |

## Support

- Windows
- OSX (untested)
